What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository creates a hidden ".git" folder where file metadata is saved in order to keep track of file history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area serves as a way to indicate wich part of the working area will become a new commit (and therefore be part of the repository). The staging area separates files to customize commit content.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The command git diff --staged allows to check the changes before commiting.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would allow alternative versions of the same code, separating future changes in different commits.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Having a visual representation of the repository structure helps determine future actions like branching and merging.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Merging two branches makes a single branch with all the commits combined (ordered by date). The merged branch is represented as the continuation of the master branch because the contents of the coins branch were added to the master branch.
