When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remotes are useful When working along other team mates.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Choosing when to update your repository gives the opportunity to work on changes sepatarely from other team mates.
