When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remotes are useful When working along other team mates.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Choosing when to update your repository gives the opportunity to work on changes sepatarely from other team mates.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches create structure for different commits. Cloning allows to copy a whole repository from an online or offline source. Forking allows to copy a whole repository from another user's github workspace while ensuring public recognition.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Having a copy of the last state of the remote helps identiy changes in the working area.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be easier to use Git to control different versions across different partners because the team transfer flow wouldn't be centralized with the alternative.
